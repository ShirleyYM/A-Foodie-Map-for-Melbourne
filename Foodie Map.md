## [Universal Restaurant](https://www.universalrestaurant.com.au/)
>__Category__: Italian food

>__Recommendation Reasons__: As they claimed, this might be the best restaurant in Melbourne. It is located on the Lygon Street which is synonymous with the Italian community of Melbourne. The price is not high but the food is good. This restaurant is also recommended by my Italian co-supervisor.


>__Recommended Cuisines__: Milano pasta, tuscan chicken, chicken schinitzel, the universal platter. (I personally prefer American pizza so I don't make any recommendation here)

>__Personal Notes__: They don't accept any booking. So arrive the restaurant before 5:30pm if you don't like to wait. One thing that I am not satisfied is that they remove the chicken schinitzel from the delivery menu :(
